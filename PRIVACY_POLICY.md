**Agendemos: Privacy policy**


**Privacy Policy**

I, William Tift built the agendemos app as a Free app, and this SERVICE is provided by myself at no cost.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.


**Information Collection and Use**

To be able to provide the Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including your Email and the Schedule events created by you in the app. The information that I request will be retained on your device, and the remote backend server. The only information shared with other users is your time availability (all the time ranges you are available because you have no event created).


**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.


**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
This policy is effective as of 2022-03-16
