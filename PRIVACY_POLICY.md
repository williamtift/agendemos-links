Agendemos: Privacy policy

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only data collected is your email, and the events created by you. The email is only used to identify your account. And the events are the main purpose of the app, they are stored and can only be viewed by yourself. The only information shared with other users is your time availability (all the time ranges you are available because you have no event created).
